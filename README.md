# ` Credit_Risk_Analysis `

## `Project Overview ` <br/>
The purpose of Credit_Risk_Analysis is to apply machine learning techniques to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.  <br/>
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. 
In this project I had  access to dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. I  oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Then I  evaluated the performance of these models and made a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk. <br/>
